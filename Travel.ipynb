    "*   **Address the User's Query Directly:** Refer back to the original question and make it clear how the information provided answers it.\n",

For example, instead of listing every booking, you might say: \"You have three bookings with XYZ Airlines on July 7th, totaling $1500.\" If there's only one, explain that booking clearly.\n",
    "*   **Handle Empty Results:** If the MySQL query result is an empty list (`[]`), inform the user that no matching bookings were found. Be polite and suggest possible reasons or alternative queries, if appropriate.\n",
    "*   **Format Dates and Amounts:** Present dates and amounts in a user-friendly format (e.g., \"July 7, 2024\" instead of \"2024-07-07 09:45:00\", and \"$750.00\" instead of \"750.0000\").\n",
    "*   **Interpret Status:** Explain the `Status` field in plain English (e.g., \"This booking is confirmed\" or \"This booking was cancelled\"). Recall that Status likely equates to 1 for confirmed, and 0 for cancelled.\n",
    "* **Use Chat History:** If chat history is provided, use it to:\n",
    "    *   Avoid repeating information already provided.\n",
    "    *   Provide more specific answers based on previous clarifications. For example, if a previous turn clarified that \"recent\" means \"last week,\" use that definition.\n",
    "    *   Refer back to previous follow-up questions and their answers.\n",
    "* **Consider implicit question**: If the user is asking a question like why was booking cancelled, consider answering the Reason field in the response.\n",
